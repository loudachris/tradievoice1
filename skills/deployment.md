# Deployment to DigitalOcean

## Description
This skill defines the standard procedure for deploying Python/FastAPI applications to the DigitalOcean App Platform. It ensures security best practices, correct dependency management, and proper runtime configuration for production environments.

## Triggers
- Deploying the application to production
- Configuring DigitalOcean App Platform
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Preparing the repository for release
- "Deploy to DigitalOcean" command

## Review Checklist
- [ ] **Secrets Management**:
    - [ ] `.env` is included in `.gitignore`.
    - [ ] `__pycache__` is included in `.gitignore`.
    - [ ] **CONFIRMED**: API keys and secrets are NEVER committed to the repository.
- [ ] **Dependencies**:
    - [ ] `requirements.txt` is clean and present.
    - [ ] Includes core packages: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `gunicorn`, `python-multipart`, `reportlab`, `openai`.
- [ ] **Entry Point**:
    - [ ] `Procfile` exists.
    - [ ] Command configured for Gunicorn/Uvicorn (e.g., `web: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker backend.main:app`).
- [ ] **Runtime**:
    - [ ] `runtime.txt` exists.
    - [ ] Python version specified is `python-3.11`.
