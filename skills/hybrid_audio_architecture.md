# Hybrid Audio Architecture

## Description
Defines the dual-mode audio logic for the application, ensuring efficient and cost-effective handling of voice interactions. It mandates a hybrid approach using WebSockets for instant commands and the MediaRecorder API for longer dictate/walkthrough modes.

### Core Logic
- **Command Mode (Pink Button)**: 
  - Usage: Instant, short commands.
  - Architecture: WebSocket (`wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`).
- **Walkthrough Mode (Toggle)**: 
  - Usage: Long dictation, walkthroughs.
  - Architecture: MediaRecorder API (Client) -> POST Blob to `/api/transcribe` (Server) -> Whisper API -> GPT-4o JSON.
- **Cost Rule**: 
  - **NEVER** use the Realtime API for long dictation tasks due to cost implications.

## Triggers
- Implementing audio features
- Developing voice command interfaces
- Setting up audio recording logic
- Optimizing OpenAI API usage
- "Command Mode" or "Walkthrough Mode" implementation

## Review Checklist
- [ ] **Command Mode Implementation**:
    - [ ] Triggered by a Pink Button (#E357AB).
    - [ ] Uses `wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime`.
- [ ] **Walkthrough Mode Implementation**:
    - [ ] Triggered by a Toggle switch.
    - [ ] Uses MediaRecorder API on the client.
    - [ ] POSTs Blob to `/api/transcribe`.
    - [ ] Server uses Whisper API -> GPT-4o JSON.
- [ ] **Cost Compliance**:
    - [ ] CONFIRMED: Realtime API is restricted to short command mode only.
    - [ ] CONFIRMED: Long dictation uses the Whisper pipeline.

## Loudachris Design Guidelines
**STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED**

All output and artifacts generated by this skill must comply with the Loudachris Design Guidelines:

1. **Rich Aesthetics**: 
   - Use vibrant colors, harmonious palettes, and modern styling (e.g., glassmorphism, dark modes).
   - Avoid generic or plain visual elements.
   
2. **Visual Excellence**:
   - Prioritize premium, state-of-the-art design.
   - Use modern typography (Inter, Roboto, etc.) over browser defaults.
   
3. **Dynamic Design**:
   - Interfaces must feel alive and responsive.
   - Include hover effects, micro-animations, and smooth transitions.
   
4. **Premium Feel**:
   - No "Minimum Viable Product" vibes. 
   - The result must WOW the user immediately.
   
5. **No Placeholders**:
   - Use generative tools to create real assets/images instead of empty boxes.
